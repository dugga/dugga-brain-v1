      The StayAlive plugin is used to &apos;ping&apos; a list of IBM i systems.

The ping will ensure that there is still a valid connection to those systems by retreiving the system value QTIME from each system.  The results of the ping can be seen in the console view. The ping can be set to happen anywhere between 1 minute and 8 hours.

The intent is to keep a connection open to those system by keeping the connection active.
